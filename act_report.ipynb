    "There does appear to be a noteworthy difference in number of favorites depending on dog breed.  For example, the 'samoyed' gets more than twice the number of likes on average than the 'pug'.  However, they all appear to be within a similar range of about 5000 to 13000 favorites.  It can be reasonably assumed that many varieties of dogs are worthy of impossibly high ratings."

    "In many of the WeRateDogs twitter posts, there are four common dog titles, 'doggo', 'floofer', 'pupper', and 'puppo', that are used in the post depending on the stage of the dog's life cycle.  Additionally, each post usually has a greater than ten put of ten rating.  It would be interesting to see if having a specific dog title has an impact on dog rating.  This is easily accomplished with python code by filtering posts that definitelly rave a rating denominator of ten, and grouping them by each primary dog title and average rating numerator.  The results are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Dog Title | Average Rating Numerator |\n",
    "| --------- | ------------------------ |\n",
    "| doggo     | $\\approx 11.90$          |\n",
    "| floofer   | $\\approx 12.00$          |\n",
    "| pupper    | $\\approx 11.06$          |\n",
    "| puppo     | $\\approx 12.00$          |\n",
    "| no title  | $\\approx 10.91$          |\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not apparent that there is significant difference between average rating for each dog title or even having a dog title.  All five of the average numerators are between 10.90 and 12.00.  However, it is hard not to notice that the average rating for titleless dogs is lower than all four title categories."
